Program 1
An array contains 30 integers. Write a program to read every 3rd element of the array, compute the square of the array and print the addition of all the suqares
E.g. [1,2,2,4,5,6,7,8,3,10]
Answer is (2x2) + (6x6) + (3x3) = 49

Program 2
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
E.g. arr = [9,5,3,7,1]
The minimum is 1+3+5+7 = 16 and the maximum is sum is 3+5+7+9 = 24.
Then print 16 24

Program 3
Given a time in -hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
Example: s = “12:01:01PM” should return '12:01:00' and “12:01:00AM” should return '00:01:00'.

Program 4
