The `Vector` class in Java is a part of the `java.util` package and provides an implementation of a dynamic array, which means it can grow as needed to accommodate more elements. `Vector` is synchronized, which makes it thread-safe for use in multithreaded environments. Here is a detailed explanation of the `Vector` class:

### Key Characteristics

1. **Dynamic Array**: A `Vector` can grow and shrink in size as needed. When elements are added, and there is no more space, the `Vector` increases its capacity automatically.
2. **Synchronized**: All methods of the `Vector` class are synchronized, making it safe to use in a multi-threaded environment. However, this also means it can be slower than unsynchronized collections like `ArrayList`.
3. **Legacy Class**: `Vector` is part of Java’s original collection framework and has been retrofitted to implement the `List` interface, making it a part of the Java Collections Framework.

### Constructors

The `Vector` class provides several constructors to initialize the vector:

- `Vector()`: Creates an empty vector with an initial capacity of 10.
- `Vector(int initialCapacity)`: Creates a vector with the specified initial capacity.
- `Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement)`: Creates a vector with the specified initial capacity and capacity increment.
- `Vector(Collection<? extends E> c)`: Creates a vector containing the elements of the specified collection, in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.

### Commonly Used Methods

Here are some commonly used methods of the `Vector` class:

- **Adding Elements**:
  - `add(E e)`: Appends the specified element to the end of this vector.
  - `add(int index, E element)`: Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this vector.
  - `addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)`: Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this vector.
  
- **Accessing Elements**:
  - `E get(int index)`: Returns the element at the specified position in this vector.
  - `int size()`: Returns the number of elements in this vector.
  - `boolean isEmpty()`: Tests if this vector has no components.
  
- **Modifying Elements**:
  - `E set(int index, E element)`: Replaces the element at the specified position in this vector with the specified element.
  
- **Removing Elements**:
  - `boolean remove(Object o)`: Removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this vector.
  - `E remove(int index)`: Removes the element at the specified position in this vector.
  - `void clear()`: Removes all of the elements from this vector.
  
- **Other Methods**:
  - `boolean contains(Object o)`: Tests if the specified object is a component in this vector.
  - `int indexOf(Object o)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this vector.
  - `Object[] toArray()`: Returns an array containing all of the elements in this vector in the correct order.

### Example Usage

Here is a simple example to demonstrate the usage of the `Vector` class:

```java
import java.util.Vector;

public class VectorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a vector
        Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>();

        // Adding elements
        vector.add("Element1");
        vector.add("Element2");
        vector.add("Element3");

        // Accessing elements
        System.out.println("First Element: " + vector.get(0)); // Output: Element1

        // Modifying elements
        vector.set(1, "ModifiedElement");
        System.out.println("Modified Vector: " + vector);

        // Removing elements
        vector.remove(2);
        System.out.println("After Removal: " + vector);

        // Checking size
        System.out.println("Vector Size: " + vector.size());
    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

While `Vector` is thread-safe due to synchronization, it can be slower than alternatives like `ArrayList` for single-threaded applications. If synchronization is not required, `ArrayList` is often preferred due to its better performance. For thread-safe operations, other alternatives like `Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>())` or `CopyOnWriteArrayList` can be considered, depending on the specific requirements.

In conclusion, the `Vector` class is a useful tool for creating dynamic arrays with built-in synchronization. However, due to performance considerations, its usage is generally limited to scenarios where thread safety is a critical requirement.
***********
In Java, the `Stack` class is a part of the `java.util` package and extends the `Vector` class, which means it inherits all the methods of the `Vector` class and adds its own methods to operate as a stack. The stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Here is a detailed explanation of the `Stack` class and its methods:

### Importing the Stack Class

To use the `Stack` class, you need to import it from the `java.util` package:

```java
import java.util.Stack;
```

### Creating a Stack

You can create a `Stack` object like this:

```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
```

### Common Methods of the Stack Class

1. **push(E item)**: Adds an item to the top of the stack.

    ```java
    stack.push(10);
    stack.push(20);
    ```

2. **pop()**: Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack. Throws `EmptyStackException` if the stack is empty.

    ```java
    int topElement = stack.pop();
    ```

3. **peek()**: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it. Throws `EmptyStackException` if the stack is empty.

    ```java
    int topElement = stack.peek();
    ```

4. **isEmpty()**: Checks if the stack is empty.

    ```java
    boolean empty = stack.isEmpty();
    ```

5. **search(Object o)**: Searches for the object in the stack and returns its 1-based position from the top of the stack. Returns -1 if the object is not found.

    ```java
    int position = stack.search(20);
    ```

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `Stack` class in Java:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Pushing elements onto the stack
        stack.push(10);
        stack.push(20);
        stack.push(30);

        // Peek at the top element
        System.out.println("Top element: " + stack.peek()); // Outputs 30

        // Pop elements from the stack
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // Outputs 30
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // Outputs 20

        // Check if stack is empty
        System.out.println("Is stack empty? " + stack.isEmpty()); // Outputs false

        // Search for an element
        System.out.println("Position of 10: " + stack.search(10)); // Outputs 1

        // Pop the last element
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // Outputs 10

        // Check if stack is empty
        System.out.println("Is stack empty? " + stack.isEmpty()); // Outputs true
    }
}
```

### Important Considerations

- The `Stack` class is synchronized, which means it is thread-safe, but this can lead to performance overhead in single-threaded applications.
- For non-synchronized stack implementation, consider using `Deque` interface and its implementations like `ArrayDeque`.

### Using Deque as a Stack

Here is an example of using `ArrayDeque` as a stack:

```java
import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Deque;

public class DequeAsStackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();

        // Pushing elements onto the stack
        stack.push(10);
        stack.push(20);
        stack.push(30);

        // Peek at the top element
        System.out.println("Top element: " + stack.peek()); // Outputs 30

        // Pop elements from the stack
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // Outputs 30
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // Outputs 20

        // Check if stack is empty
        System.out.println("Is stack empty? " + stack.isEmpty()); // Outputs false

        // Pop the last element
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // Outputs 10

        // Check if stack is empty
        System.out.println("Is stack empty? " + stack.isEmpty()); // Outputs true
    }
}
```

Using `ArrayDeque` provides a non-synchronized alternative to `Stack` that can be more efficient in single-threaded scenarios.

***********
The `ArrayDeque` class in Java, part of the `java.util` package, provides a resizable-array implementation of the `Deque` interface. A deque (double-ended queue) is a linear collection that supports element insertion, removal, and retrieval at both ends. The `ArrayDeque` class is not thread-safe and does not support concurrent access by multiple threads without external synchronization.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Resizable Array**: The `ArrayDeque` class is implemented using a resizable array, which means it can grow dynamically as elements are added.
2. **Double-Ended Queue**: It allows for efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of elements at both the front and the back of the queue.
3. **No Capacity Restrictions**: There are no fixed capacity limits for an `ArrayDeque`, and it can grow as needed to accommodate additional elements.
4. **No Null Elements**: `ArrayDeque` does not allow the insertion of `null` elements.
5. **Non-Synchronized**: It is not synchronized, meaning it is not thread-safe without external synchronization.

### Constructors

The `ArrayDeque` class provides several constructors:

- `ArrayDeque()`: Constructs an empty deque.
- `ArrayDeque(int initialCapacity)`: Constructs an empty deque with the specified initial capacity.
- `ArrayDeque(Collection<? extends E> c)`: Constructs a deque containing the elements of the specified collection, in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.

### Commonly Used Methods

Here are some of the commonly used methods of the `ArrayDeque` class:

- **Adding Elements**:
  - `add(E e)`: Adds the specified element to the end of the deque.
  - `addFirst(E e)`: Inserts the specified element at the front of the deque.
  - `addLast(E e)`: Inserts the specified element at the end of the deque.
  - `offer(E e)`: Inserts the specified element at the end of the deque (returns `true` upon success).
  - `offerFirst(E e)`: Inserts the specified element at the front of the deque.
  - `offerLast(E e)`: Inserts the specified element at the end of the deque.

- **Accessing Elements**:
  - `E getFirst()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of the deque.
  - `E getLast()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of the deque.
  - `E peek()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the deque.
  - `E peekFirst()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of the deque.
  - `E peekLast()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of the deque.

- **Removing Elements**:
  - `E remove()`: Retrieves and removes the head of the deque.
  - `E remove

***********
In Java, `PriorityQueue` is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to hold elements that are to be processed based on their priority. Unlike a standard queue that processes elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order, a `PriorityQueue` orders its elements based on their natural ordering or by a `Comparator` provided at queue construction time.

### Key Characteristics of PriorityQueue

1. **Ordering**:
   - The elements of the `PriorityQueue` are ordered either by natural ordering (if they implement `Comparable`) or by a specified `Comparator`.
   - The head of this queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering. This is the element that is removed first.

2. **Heap-Based Implementation**:
   - `PriorityQueue` is typically implemented using a binary heap, which ensures that basic operations like insertions and deletions take logarithmic time, O(log n).

3. **Null Elements Not Permitted**:
   - `PriorityQueue` does not allow `null` elements.

4. **Unbounded but Bounded by Memory**:
   - Although a `PriorityQueue` is unbounded in size, it is constrained by available memory.

### Important Methods

- **add(E e) / offer(E e)**:
  - Inserts the specified element into this priority queue.
  - `add` will throw an exception if the element cannot be added, whereas `offer` will return `false`.

- **poll()**:
  - Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns `null` if this queue is empty.

- **peek()**:
  - Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns `null` if this queue is empty.

- **remove(Object o)**:
  - Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue, if it is present.

- **iterator()**:
  - Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue. The iterator does not guarantee any specific order of iteration.

### Example Usage

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use a `PriorityQueue` in Java:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class PriorityQueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a PriorityQueue of integers (min-heap by default)
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // Add elements to the PriorityQueue
        pq.add(4);
        pq.add(2);
        pq.add(5);
        pq.add(1);
        pq.add(3);

        // Display the elements in the PriorityQueue
        System.out.println("Elements in PriorityQueue: " + pq);

        // Retrieve and remove elements from the PriorityQueue
        System.out.println("Polling elements from PriorityQueue:");
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(pq.poll());
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom Comparator

To use a custom ordering, you can provide a `Comparator` when creating the `PriorityQueue`. Here’s an example with a custom comparator:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class CustomPriorityQueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Custom Comparator for reverse order (max-heap)
        Comparator<Integer> customComparator = (a, b) -> b - a;

        // Create a PriorityQueue with custom Comparator
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(customComparator);

        // Add elements to the PriorityQueue
        pq.add(4);
        pq.add(2);
        pq.add(5);
        pq.add(1);
        pq.add(3);

        // Display the elements in the PriorityQueue
        System.out.println("Elements in PriorityQueue: " + pq);

        // Retrieve and remove elements from the PriorityQueue
        System.out.println("Polling elements from PriorityQueue:");
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(pq.poll());
        }
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **`PriorityQueue`** in Java is a heap-based priority queue.
- It processes elements based on their priority, determined by natural ordering or a custom comparator.
- Common operations include `add`, `offer`, `poll`, `peek`, and `remove`.
- It is useful in scenarios where elements need to be processed according to their priority rather than their insertion order.

Using `PriorityQueue`, you can efficiently manage and process elements where priority is a key factor, such as task scheduling, event simulation, and algorithm implementations like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
