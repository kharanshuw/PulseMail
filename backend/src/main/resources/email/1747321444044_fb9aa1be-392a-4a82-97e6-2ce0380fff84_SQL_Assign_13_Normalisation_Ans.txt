Step 1: Identify Entities and Attributes

Books
ISBN (Primary Key)
Title
Publisher
Publication Year
Price
Stock Quantity

Authors
Author ID (Primary Key)
First Name
Last Name

Customers
Customer ID (Primary Key)
First Name
Last Name
Email
Phone

Orders
Order ID (Primary Key)
Customer ID (Foreign Key)
Order Date
Total Amount

Sales (Sales items within an order)
Sale ID (Primary Key)
Order ID (Foreign Key)
Book ISBN (Foreign Key)
Quantity
Subtotal

Step 2: Analyze Dependencies and Relationships
Books have a many-to-many relationship with Authors. An author can write multiple books, and a book can have multiple authors. To resolve this, we'll need an intermediate table.
Orders have a many-to-one relationship with Customers, meaning a customer can place multiple orders.
Sales have a many-to-one relationship with Orders, as each sale item is part of a specific order. Each sale item is also associated with a specific book.

Step 3: Normalize the Database
1st Normal Form (1NF)
Ensure that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values, and there are no repeating groups.
Books
ISBN, Title, Publisher, Publication Year, and Price are atomic.
Authors
Author ID, First Name, and Last Name are atomic.
Customers
Customer ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone are atomic.
Orders
Order ID, Customer ID, Order Date, and Total Amount are atomic.
Sales
Sale ID, Order ID, Book ISBN, Quantity, and Subtotal are atomic.

2nd Normal Form (2NF)
Ensure that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.

Books (No changes needed)
Authors (No changes needed)
Customers (No changes needed)
Orders (No changes needed)
Sales
The combination of Sale ID is already dependent on Book ISBN. No partial dependencies exist.

3rd Normal Form (3NF)
Ensure that there are no transitive dependencies, i.e., non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

Books (No changes needed)
Authors (No changes needed)
Customers (No changes needed)
Orders (No changes needed)
Sales
The Book ISBN and Quantity are dependent on Sale ID. However, the Subtotal is dependent on Quantity and Book ISBN. To achieve 3NF, create a new table for Books and their ISBN-Quantity associations:
New Table: BookDetails
Book ISBN (Primary Key)
Quantity
Subtotal
The Sales table now references the BookDetails table by Book ISBN.

Step 4: Final Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The final ERD will consist of the following tables:

Books
Authors
Customers
Orders
Sales
BookDetails
Each table should have a primary key, and foreign keys where necessary to maintain referential integrity.

By following this normalization process, the database for the online bookstore is now in 3rd normal form, reducing data redundancy and ensuring data integrity.
